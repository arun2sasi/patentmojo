==========

An example web app for demonstrating the power of the tastymonster test framework

This is a small web application and automation framework, composed for a minimal demo given at the Selenium Conference in London April 17, 2012. Many things still need to be worked out and improved, but this is being made public so that people can have a look at how we did the things we did. It is our hope that we may be able to expand this into a full-fledged framework atop Selenium/WebDriver, and that the Page Object generation ideas in here can be made agnostic to any presentation layer implementation out there.

For now, play around, enjoy, and remember--the web app itself is intentionally simplistic and terrible. Our intention is for you to have a look at the ideas behind the testing.

Pre-requisites:
===============

- Java JDK 1.6 or later
- Maven, configured to be executable from command-line
- Everything else should auto-configure itself with Maven

Optional:
- IDE of your choice. I've included instructions for both Eclipse and IntelliJ, though you don't really need either

To Use
==========

This assumes you have installed the tastymonster framework (i.e. you have followed the steps in the README from that project)

Prior to using any IDE, you need to generate some files before it will compile:

From the command-line
- git clone git@github.com:mmerrell/patentmojo.git
- mvn -P generatePages exec:java clean verify

Eclipse:
- From eclipse, create a new Java Project by pointing to this folder
- Right-click on the project, then Configure->Convert to Maven Project

- mvn jetty:run

- Open a browser at http://localhost:8080/patentmojo/index.vm
- Locate TestUsers.java, right-click, then Run As->TestNG

You should see the fully rendered and functioning web app. It's not designed well enough to look "good", but it should at least look like a web site
